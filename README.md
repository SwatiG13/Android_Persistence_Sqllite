# Android_Persistence_Sqllite
User can perform CRUD operation using sqllite . Example : Person details

You have inserted your first data set to a SQLite table in Android application. Don’t you sure about it? I will prove it to you. Go to;

Window -> Open Perspective -> DDMS
open File Explorer window
explore “data” directory
inside that you will find another “data” directory. Explore it too
Then you will be able to find your package name of this application (Ex: com.anuja.sqlite)
Go inside that
Now you can see the “database” directory.
